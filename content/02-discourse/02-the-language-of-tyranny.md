# The Language of Tyranny
Tyranny is rarely imposed in the name of tyranny.  It instead strips away freedom using pleasant language, such as "greater good", "anti hate", or "safeguarding the public interest".  "Don't worry", those in power will say. "You are in good hands", "we use power responsibly", "only bad people need to worry". And if any decry the potential for overreach, well those must be alarmists and conspiracy theorists.  Silencing them might be necessary for the greater good as well.

To protect freedom, we must reclaim the linguistic territory.  Abuse of power depends on abuse of language. We can push back on this by refusing to let authoritarians steal our words from us.  Here are some examples to watch out for.

Hate Crime

Don't use the term "hate crime", call it "thought crime".  This more accurately highlights that government is coercing mind in addition to body.  You can't control what terminology others use, but every time they say hate crime, you can ask them to clarify if they were referring to thought crime, and be sure to refer to it that way yourself no matter what others do.  For example, if a paternalist says something like "There is no place for hate crime in a civil society", you can respond with something like "Oh, are you referring to thought crime?". Treating a "hate crime" differently than a "crime" demonstrates government overreach from legitimate protective use of force, to the tyrannical criminalization of thought.

Offended

No one ever "offended" anyone else, it is only ever the case that someone "took offense", or found something offensive.  Avoid saying you did not mean to offend, as that is taken as admission to guilt of causing offense, and wrongly implies that it is possible for you to control how others interpret what you say.  Instead emphasize your intention to speak truth clearly, and that you do not have or even want the power to control how someone feels about what you say. If the same words can be considered offensive to some and not others, then the difference is in the individuals taking offense, not the words themselves.  

Racism

Racism is the idea people should be judged by their ancestry rather than merit.  The choice to immigrate illegally is not a race.  One's religion, whether chosen or not, is not a race.  Racist ideas do not become any less racist because one lacks power or privilege.  Any time an accusation of racism is leveled, ask who is being judged based on ancestry rather than merit.  To any who think privileged treatment based on ancestry is justifiable, remind them of the famous Martin Luther King Jr. quote.  Individuals should "not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character". Do not let them escape the stigma of "racist" with their manipulative definitions that make it okay when they do it.

Violence

Expressing and idea can not be violence.  This includes ideas expressed as satire, irony, joke, metaphor, analogy, fiction, art or speaking plainly.  The intent of an expression is irrelevant. It is still not violence. Declaring certain ideas as violence is an authoritarians dream.  If one can simply deem opposing opinions as "violence", this creates a self-defense justification of using physical force to shut down anyone who disagrees with those possessing the power to define which speech is violent.  Any time someone talks about "violent speech", or refers to speech as violence, ask how the words caused physical damage. Was someone shot with voice activated gun? Was an assassination verbally ordered? These are not exceptions to the rule, they are actual acts of violence, completely different from expressions of ideas.  Be clear in your wording to separate acts of violence from acts of expressing an idea. If it is not physical, it can not be violence.

 

Lets be sure that as liberalists, we are precise about our language, and do not let authoritarians define our words for us, no matter how well meaning they may be.
