# Discourse
The free exchange of ideas is essential for a functioning democracy.  Without the ability to make informed decisions, there is no way to work out the details of protecting individual freedom in practice.  Bad ideas have a much harder time surviving scrutiny than good ideas, so it is common for those with bad ideas to try to silence their opposition to compensate for the weakness of their argument.

To defend against oppression, you must first be sure you don’t become the oppressor.  If you feel the need to silence others, the problem is not with them, but with your own inability or unwillingness to form a better counter-argument.  De-platforming, the heckler’s veto, responding to words with violence, these are the tools resorted to by those without reason and evidence on their side, and if the facts are not on your side, you are on the wrong side.
