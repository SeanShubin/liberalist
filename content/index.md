# Why Liberalism?
The ultimate goal is individual freedom.
The right to individual freedom comes with a corresponding responsibility to not violate the individual freedom of others.
For example, the right not to be punched in the face comes with the corresponding responsibility not to punch others in the face.
If it were the case that all individuals were willing to not violate the rights of others without coercion, anarchy would be ideal.
However, since we can not rely on the all individuals to behave, we need the state to protect individual rights.

A “state” is a compulsory political organization with a centralized government that maintains a monopoly of the legitimate use of force within a certain geographical territory.
For a state to be liberal, it must have the following qualities:

1. It must be empowered to protect individual freedom by being granted sole authority for legitimate use of force.
2. It must be narrowly scoped by a constitution such that it can not be manipulated to violate individual freedom.
3. It’s realization in practice must be accountable to the individuals who constitute it, such as by representative democracy.

These qualities together, make constitutional democracy a necessary, although not sufficient, condition for a state to be liberal.
The state derives its authority from a social contract entered into by every citizen within its borders possessing moral agency.
The state is obligated to protect the parts of itself necessary to protect individual freedom.
The state’s constitution must limit its own power sufficiently to prevent tyranny of the majority.
Free exchange of ideas are essential to the integrity of a democracy, so the state must protect its citizens from censorship and compelled speech.

There are many ideologies that can also be liberal according to their implementation, such as some forms of social democracy, objectivism, and libertarianism.

There are also many ideologies that can not be liberal due to their prioritization of the collective over the individual, such as communism, socialism, and fascism.

Many forms of paternalism are well meaning, but all of them are illiberal because they deny the individual the right to determine for themselves what is in their own best interest.

There will inevitably be extreme situations where it is seemingly impossible for the state to protect everyones individual freedom, such as war, pandemic, or famine.  However, as long those charged with executing state responsibilities are acting in a principled manner, this does not represent the state being illiberal, but the reality that it is sometimes impossible to perfectly protect the totality of individual freedom in practice.
