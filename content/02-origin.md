# Origin
In early 2018, youtuber Sargon of Akkad suggested using a label to positively assert a specific set of core beliefs in line with the spirit of liberalism.  In his words, “If someone who promotes Feminism is a Feminist, and someone who promotes Socialism is a Socialist, and someone who promotes Islamism is an Islamist, and someone who promotes Fascism is a Fascist, then someone who promotes Liberalism must be a Liberalist.  I say we use this label until it’s dead or we find something better.”.

Sargon of Akkad has since created [The Liberalist Society](http://liberalists.org/) website, where he listed a set of principles focused on liberalism.  As promoters of liberal values tend to be independently minded individualists, many have self-organized to create a subreddit, discord server, facebook group, and other resources.
