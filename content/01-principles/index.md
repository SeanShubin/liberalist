# Principles
(from [liberalists.org](http://liberalists.org/principles/))

This statement of principles is a list of the values that Liberalists hold as ideals. We also recognize that we live in the real world and that no set of principles can ever be fully realized, but promoting this worldview will produce a demonstrably better society than the current alternatives.

### Individual Rights
Protecting the rights of the individual must be the highest value of society, to foster mutual tolerance and respect towards the cultivation of the dignity of every person.

### Freedom of speech
Freedom of expression is a necessary and fundamental pillar of a free society.

### Economic Freedom
Property rights that begin with personal self-ownership and private property creates the most productive societies.

### Democracy
Constitutional democracy is the best way for a free citizenry to maintain a state and resist tyranny.

### Self-reliance
People possess agency and should be treated as such because treating people like victims becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

### Blind Justice
Each individual should be governed by the same laws as their peers without arbitrary discrimination and be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a fair trial.

### Secularism
Everybody is free to practice their religion, or not, as long as it does not interfere with the rights of others.
